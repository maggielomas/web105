            <p>Banana bread, made from mashed bananas, is a sweet and moist bread.</p>

            <p>Banana bread does not need time to rise,
                so it is known as a quick bread. The baking soda/powder
                is what makes it rise so quickly.

            <h2>The History of Banana Bread</h2>
            <figure class="left"><img src="bananabread2.jpg" alt="bananabread2"></figure>


            <p>In the 1800s, bananas were only available very sparingly
                because they are not native to North America. Bananas ripe and
                rotten very quickly, so it was difficult to get them across
                seas.
            </p>

            <p>During the Great Depression, food was very hard to come by so
                even a rotten banana was kept around. Paired with baking powder,
                a recipe was made up for banana bread. It was new to add mashed
                bananas into the recipe as a main ingredient instead of as a garnish.
            </p>

            <p>Banana bread became so popular, there is even a day for it.
                National Banana Bread Day is on February 23rd.
            </p>

            <p>According to <a
                    href="https://www.mygreatrecipes.com/blog/7-fun-facts-about-bananas-and-banana-bread-you-didnt-know/">My
                    Great Recipes</a>, The first banana bread recipe appeared in
                Pillsbury's Balanced Recipes Cookbook.
            </p>

            <p>Cooking experts claim that banana bread is more like a cake
                than a bread because it does not contain any yeast.
            </p>

            <p>Our banana bread recipes are all mutants. The good old yellow banana we all eat and love is a genetic
                variation on the
                numerous other varieties (more than 500 to be more precise). It is also the sweetest variety of all.
                Furthermore,
                bananas appear in a whole rainbow of colors â€“ some are even vibrant pink and taste more like
                strawberries. They also
                come in many shapes and sizes, from large purple-colored plantains to tiny finger fruits.</p>
